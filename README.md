I'm a Puerto Rico–based computer scientist & engineer and an alumnus of the University of Puerto Rico at Mayagüez, where I completed my B.S. in Computer Science and Engineering in 2025. My work sits at the intersection of computational methods and bioengineering, with a focus on building robust systems that remain reliable under dynamic, real-world constraints. I'm beginning graduate studies in Bioengineering at UPRM under the advisement of Dr. Maribella Domenech, under the NSF AIRFoundry to work on targeted extracellular vesicle (EVs) and lipid nanoparticle (LNPs) delivery design for programmable therapeutics. I'm also committed to mentorship and capacity-building for students in Puerto Rico, aiming to translate rigorous research into tools and workflows that reach underserved settings.

My background is intentionally cross-disciplinary. I've conducted research at the University of Puerto Rico at Mayagüez in chemistry, population genetics, signal processing, and computer vision. My work goes beyond, including summer stints at the University of Iowa, NVIDIA, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Apple/University of Southern California. I've participated in multiple computational-professional development programs with Brookhaven National Laboratory, MIT, and the San Diego Supercomputer Center, and in leadership programs as a Hispanic Scholarship Fund Scholar, Apple Scholar, Google LSLS, and NACME Scholar.

Currently, beyond graduate studies, I'm co-founder and CEO of Capicú Technologies, a deep tech startup that deploys on-device intelligence where biomedical data is collected. His efforts has lead a team of engineers & scientists to develop Capicú Edge ML Inference (CEMI), an open-source visualization tool to abstract away model compression and deployment in edge devices, where traditional infrastructure is absent.
