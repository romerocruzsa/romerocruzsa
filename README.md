# Hola! My name is Sebasti√°n. (si-bast-ee-uhn)
## üáµüá∑ _Boricua aunque naciera en la Luna_
My name is Sebasti√°n A. Cruz Romero and I am from Juana D√≠az, Puerto Rico, located in the south side of Puerto Rico. I currently reside in Mayag√ºez as I am a rising senior at the University of Puerto Rico at Mayag√ºez majoring in Computer Science and Engineering.

## üß¨ Technology, Medicine and Biology
While my academic training is in engineering and computing, I do have a keen interest in the life sciences and research. Particularly, my interests align in two things: computational approaches to biological phenomena. My last research project for the Computational Optics and Imaging Laboratory (COIL UPRM) under the mentorship of Dr. Heidy Sierra, we leverage the use of biomedical signals to detect abnormalities in a persons health vitals. Our work prioritized minimally or non-invasive ways to acquire medical data, therefore, the use of electrocardiography (EEG) or photoplethysmography (PPG) to estimate changes in blood volume that could be correlated with sepsis through oxygen saturation, blood pressure or heart rate.
