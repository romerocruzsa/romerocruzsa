# Hola! My name is Sebasti√°n. (si-bast-ee-uhn)
## üáµüá∑ _Boricua aunque naciera en la Luna_
My name is Sebasti√°n A. Cruz Romero and I am from Juana D√≠az, Puerto Rico, located in the south side of Puerto Rico. I currently reside in Mayag√ºez as I am a rising senior at the University of Puerto Rico at Mayag√ºez majoring in Computer Science and Engineering.

## üß¨ Technology, Medicine and Biology
While my academic training is in engineering and computing, I do have a keen interest in the life sciences and research. Particularly, my interests align in two things: computational approaches to biological phenomena. My last research project for the Computational Optics and Imaging Laboratory ([COIL UPRM](https://larsip.uprm.edu/projects/nsf-career/)) under the mentorship of [Dr. Heidy Sierra](https://pr.linkedin.com/in/heidy-sierra-68129552), we leverage the use of biomedical signals to detect abnormalities in a persons health vitals. Our work prioritized minimally or non-invasive ways to acquire medical data, therefore, the use of electrocardiography (EEG) or photoplethysmography (PPG) to estimate changes in blood volume that could be correlated with sepsis through oxygen saturation, blood pressure or heart rate. Our work was presented at the International Symposium on Intelligent Computing and Networking (ISICN) 2024 and can read our most recent publication in the following [link](https://www.isicn.org/2024/program.html).

## üìç Where Am I Now?
Currently, I'm in Los √Ångeles, CA participating in the Apple and NACME Inc. Artificial Intelligence-Machine Learning (AIML) Intensive Bootcamp hosted by the University of Southern California (USC) Viterbi School of Engineering and the School of Advanced Computing. Under the mentorship of [Dr. Corey E. Baker](https://netrecon.usc.edu/baker/) I am provided with an introduction to computer science content to be qualified for positions as entry-level Machine Learning (ML) Specialists. Specifically, to to understand how to apply statistics and ML to solve real-world data science problems. If you want to learn more about the program, you can do so in the following [link](https://www.nacme.org/bootcamp).
